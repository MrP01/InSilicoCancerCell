# If you uncomment this line, it will enable `wee_alloc`:
default = ["wee_alloc"]
# `wee_alloc` is a tiny allocator for wasm that is only ~1K in code size
# compared to the default allocator's ~10K. However, it is slower than the default
# allocator, so it's not enabled by default.

# The `web-sys` crate allows you to interact with the various browser APIs, like the DOM.

# The `console_error_panic_hook` crate provides better debugging of panics by
# logging them with `console.error`. This is great for development, but requires
# all the `std::fmt` and `std::panicking` infrastructure, so it's only enabled
# in debug mode.
