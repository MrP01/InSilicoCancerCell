We here propose a first simplified hidden Markov Model (HMM) for the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.1, taking into account the channels{\textquoteright} specific activation and inac-tivation characteristics close to physiological tempera-ture. The modeling approach and simulation results were compared with an existing Hodgkin Huxley model based on the same experimental data. The newly developed HMM shows a higher accuracy with regard to the activation and inactivation behavior com-pared to the Hodgkin Huxley approach.},
